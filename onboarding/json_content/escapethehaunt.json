The story is exciting\n\t\tand capturing, the art style fits the genre, and the images created are great visual aids to\n\t\thelp the players immerse themselves in the story.

As\n\t\tof this writing, the image creation has taken so long that it is almost impossible to stay\n\t\tengaged. When this changes, though, it will be nothing short of a 5-star GPT!\n\t</p>\n", "curatorsrating": "3", "ytshorturl": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6RqNchC2EMM"}
